## Upsell Optimization: Bridging BI Insights and Customer Eligibility with AI

### Overview

This project focuses on optimizing upsell campaigns for a city carrier in the telecom industry. Leveraging a solution powered by AI, we aim to determine the eligibility of each customer for specific upsell offers based on a set of rules provided by the BI department. The challenge lies in handling technical and business constraints, as well as utilizing additional information from the commercial department.

### Usage

To utilize this code for your upsell optimization:

1. Ensure you have the required data files: 'Business Translation Case_Customer Data.csv', 'Business Translation Case_Tec Restrictions.csv', and 'Business Translation Case_Action Space.csv'.
2. Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file
3. Run the provided code in a Python environment.
4. The resulting `all_actions` dictionary contains eligibility flags for each customer and action.

### Note

This implementation aims to enhance transparency in the upsell optimization process, providing a clear understanding of the criteria and eligibility for each customer.
